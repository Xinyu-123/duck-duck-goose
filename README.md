# Duck Duck Goose
Adds life to the world by putting ducks in bodies of water that don't currently have them.

I wonder if the ducks would appreciate some bread?

Currently adds ducks to the following locations:

* Yanille pond
* Barbarian Village river fishing spot
* Zulandra
* Underground Dark Meyer Bloodveld Area
* South of the Farming Guild
* Fossil Island Cleaning Pool
* POH Ponds
* Lletya
